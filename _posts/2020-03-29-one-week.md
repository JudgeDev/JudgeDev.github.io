# Time flies - one week on

So, I am sitting here after one week of lockdown wondering where the time went.

I am still working, in fact, without any managers in sight, I've never been more concentrated or productive. I also sorted a huge stack of papers into files ready to extract the relevant ones for my tax returns for an alarming number of back years. Whoops.

I looked at Lessons 8 and 9 of fastai and worked through most of the code in Lesson 8. This is taking some time because:

- I am trying to draw up the reference chart that I mentioned in the last post for all the material as I go through it.

- When I got to the part about refactoring (L8@1:58:33), I decided to do it in the PyCharm IDE and learn about the refectoring tools it has. In turn, that prompted me to re-read parts of Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler et al. and try to map the names in PyCharm to the cases listed in the book.
