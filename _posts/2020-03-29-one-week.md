# Time flies - one week on

So, I am sitting here after one week of lockdown wondering where the time went.

I am still working, in fact, without any managers in sight, I've never been more concentrated or productive. I also sorted a huge stack of papers into files ready to extract the relevant ones for my tax returns for an alarming number of back years. Whoops.

I looked at Lessons 8 and 9 of fastai and worked through most of the code in Lesson 8. This is taking some time because:

- I am trying to draw up the reference chart that I mentioned in the last post for all the material as I go through it.

- When I got to the [part about refactoring](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=8
&t=1h58m33s)(L8@1:58:33), I decided to do it in the PyCharm IDE and learn about the refactoring tools it has. In turn, that prompted me to re-read parts of [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler et al.](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html). There are some notes on the book [here](https://gist.github.com/deanhunt/1c0ca8c5fe17b9b4f34a). I then tried to map the names of the refactorings in PyCharm to the cases listed in the book. I then tried to use the tools to follow Jeremy's refactoring of the fit loop.

- I looked at other random stuff. Notably the [MIT OCW course on AI](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/) by Patrick Henry Winston, who is a great presenter. In fact, he has a great presentation on presenting [here](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=patrick+henry+winston+how+to+give+a+lecture&&view=detail&mid=E3308D6F22A102BF3236E3308D6F22A102BF3236&&FORM=VRDGAR&ru=%2Fvideos%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dpatrick%2520henry%2520winston%2520how%2520to%2520give%2520a%2520lecture%26qs%3Dn%26form%3DQBVR%26sp%3D-1%26pq%3Dpatrick%2520henry%2520winston%2520how%2520to%2520give%2520a%2520lectur%26sc%3D0-42%26sk%3D%26cvid%3D8863C1BA440D4F1EA9526EF3792A4797).
